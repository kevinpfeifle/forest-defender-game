# Forest Defender Game

An incomplete and unsubmitted Game Jam game. Time ran out before this project could be completed. Contains code for optimized platforming (input buffering, "coyote time", variable height jumps, etc). The platforming is "optimized" to some degree, and feels good to control. Contains simple parallax configurations.

The game was meant to be a platformer blended with a form of "tower defense". The player would navigate the tree canopy, creating defenses to protect it from the coming troll invasion.
