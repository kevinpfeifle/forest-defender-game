# Forest Defender Game

An incomplete and unsubmitted Game Jam game. Time ran out before this project could be completed. Contains code for optimized platforming (input buffering, "coyote time", variable height jumps, etc). The platforming is "optimized" to some degree, and feels good to control. Contains simple parallax configurations.
